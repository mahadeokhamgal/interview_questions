Phase 1 – Today (2 hours) – Focus on these 25 questions (the ones asked in 90 % of such interviews)
Core JavaScript / TypeScript (30-40 min)

1. Difference between let, const, and var. Hoisting and Temporal Dead Zone.
2. Explain closures with a real-world example (why they are heavily used in Angular services).
3. Event loop – What happens when you click a button in Angular? (call stack → microtasks → macrotasks)
4. == vs ===, type coercion examples.
5. Explain this in JavaScript – how it behaves in arrow functions vs normal functions (very common in Angular templates).
6. Promises vs Observables – when would you use each in an Angular app?
7. How does async/await work under the hood?
8. TypeScript: interface vs type, unknown vs any, utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit, Record).
9. What are decorators in TypeScript? How are @Component, @Input, @Output implemented?
10. Generics in TypeScript – write a simple generic pipe or service example.

Angular Deep Dive (60-70 min) – This will be 60-70 % of your interview

11. Angular architecture – modules, components, services, dependency injection.
12. Change detection – default strategy vs OnPush. When and why to use OnPush, how do enforce onpush as default strategy in angular?
13. Zone.js – what does it do? Can we run Angular without Zone.js (NgZone)?
14. Lazy loading modules – syntax and how the router knows which chunk to load, How to customize the chunk name in for lazy loaded module?
15. RxJS operators you use daily: map, switchMap, mergeMap, concatMap, exhaustMap, take, takeUntil, debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged.
16. How do you unsubscribe from Observables? (takeUntil, AsyncPipe, manual subscription patterns).
17. Angular Ivy – what changed compared to ViewEngine?
18. @Input() + @Output() vs services for communication – when to use what?
19. Angular forms – Template-driven vs Reactive. When do you prefer Reactive?
20. Custom pipes, directives – give examples you have written.
How to optimize Angular bundle size (lazy loading, tree-shaking, differential loading).
Angular Universal / SSR – have you used it? Why is it important for B2B tools?
Standalone components (Angular 14+) – are you using them in your project?
Signals (Angular 16+) – basic idea and when you would use them instead of RxJS.
How does Angular handle security: XSS, CSRF, HttpClient XSS protection.

Phase 2 – Tomorrow Morning (first 2-3 hours) – High-Probability Questions
Micro-Frontends & Telekom Scale (they use Single-SPA + Telekom Scale)

What is a micro-frontend? Advantages and challenges.
Have you worked with Single-SPA or any micro-frontend framework?
How do you share libraries/state between micro-frontends?
Telekom Scale – what is it? (It’s DT’s open-source design system + component library built on StencilJS/Web Components).
How would you build a shell that loads multiple Angular micro-frontends?

API Integration & Authentication (very likely)

How do you call REST APIs in Angular? (HttpClient, interceptors).
Write an Auth interceptor that adds JWT to every request and refreshes token on 401.
OIDC flow – what is Authorization Code + PKCE? Why PKCE in SPAs?
Difference between JWT and SAML (both are mentioned in JD).
How do you store tokens securely in the browser?

Testing & Quality

Unit testing in Angular – Jasmine vs Jest, Karma vs no browser.
How do you mock HTTP calls in tests? (HttpClientTestingModule).
End-to-end testing – Cypress vs Protractor vs Playwright.
What is WireMock / Mockito / RestAssured? (mentioned in JD – backend testing tools, just know names).

DevOps & Tools (they love GitLab + Kubernetes)

GitLab CI/CD pipeline stages you have defined for frontend.
How do you build and deploy an Angular app to Kubernetes?
What is Helm? Have you written a Helm chart for a frontend app?
What is the purpose of Dynatrace / Prometheus / Grafana / Jaeger in a frontend context?

Phase 3 – Tomorrow Afternoon (last 2-3 hours) – Good to Have + Behavioral
Architecture & System Design (30-40 min)

Design a responsive dashboard for the FIT Tool (requirements: role-based access, real-time updates, 10+ widgets).
How would you structure a large Angular application (Nx monorepo vs Angular Workspace vs standalone)?
State management – when do you use services, NgRx, or Signals?

Behavioral & Process Questions

Explain a complex frontend problem you solved recently.
How do you ensure WCAG 2.1 accessibility in Angular apps?
How do you document your components (Storybook vs Compodoc vs Confluence)?
Experience with Agile – what ceremonies do you participate in? How do you estimate stories?

Bonus (Telekom-specific – nice to know)

What is Tardis platform? (Internal developer portal at DT – just say you read it’s their internal platform for microservices).
Why do you want to work on B2B telecom products?
