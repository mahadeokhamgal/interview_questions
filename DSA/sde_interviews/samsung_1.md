R1. Q1. Colourful Knapsack.
`You are given N stones, labeled from 1 to N. The i-th stone has the weight W[i]. There are M colors, labeled by integers from 1 to M. The i-th stone has the color C[i] (of course, an integer between 1 to M, inclusive). You want to fill a Knapsack with these stones. The Knapsack can hold a total weight of X. You want to select exactly M stones; one of each color. The sum of the weights of the stones must not exceed X. Since you paid a premium for a Knapsack with capacity X (as opposed to a Knapsack with a lower capacity), you want to fill the Knapsack as much as possible.`
`Write a program that takes all the above values as input and calculates the best way to fill the Knapsack â€“ that is, the way that minimizes the unused capacity. Output this unused capacity.`
This one is in To do. - bit overhead.
