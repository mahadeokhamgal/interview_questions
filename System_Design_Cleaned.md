# What is Vertical and Horizontal scaling?
# Why is horizontal scaling needed if vertical scaling is available?
# What is Leader/(Master)-Follower architecture?
# What is Sharding and Partitioning?
# Can two partitions have identical data? Why?
# When to use sharding and when not to?
# Explain how the Centralized Workflow works.
# Explain scenarios when youâ€™d recommend NOT using Node.js.
