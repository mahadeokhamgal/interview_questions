### JavaScript Programming Questions

```js
// 1. Variable shadowing and hoisting
let a =10;
{
  let a = 20;
  {
    console.log(a);
    let a = 30;
    console.log(a);
  }
  console.log(a);
}

// 2. Function and arrow function hoisting
console.log("z");
a();
b();
function a() { console.log("a"); }
console.log("c");
var b = () => { console.log("b"); }
console.log("d");

// 3. Asynchronous setTimeout
for (var x = 0; x <= 5; x++) {
  printVal(x);
}
let printVal = (z) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(z);
  }, 0);
};

// 4. Object property confusion
const arr = ["name"];
const obj = { name: "hi" };
obj.name = "Hi";
obj[arr] = "how?";
console.log(obj.name); // Output?

// 5. Comparison
let a = [1,2,3];
let b = [1,2,3];
let c = "1,2,3";
console.log(a == c); // true
console.log(b == c); // true
console.log(a == b); // false

// 6. Sparse array
let a = [1,2,3,4,5];
a[10] = 10;
console.log(a.length); // 11

// 7. Async/Await vs Promise
async function async1() {
  console.log('async1 start');
  await async2();
  console.log('async1 end');
}
async function async2() {
  console.log('async2');
}
console.log('script start');
setTimeout(() => { console.log('setTimeout'); }, 0);
async1();
new Promise(function(resolve) {
  console.log('promise1');
  resolve();
}).then(function() {
  console.log('promise2');
});
new Promise(function(resolve) {
  console.log('promise3');
  resolve();
}).then(function() {
  console.log('promise4');
});
console.log('script end');
