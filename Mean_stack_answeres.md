# Angular

- **MergeMap(Parallel Execution) vs Fork Join.**
    - MergeMap doesn't wait for all observables to complete/emit a value 
    - vs
    - Formjoin waits for all observables to emit atleast one value.
    - MergeMap is good in case response is needed for every subject if any comes in irrespective of any other      observable.
    - vs
    - Forkjoin is good in case processing should happen after all observables resolve.
    - Both MergeMap and forkJoin execute all observables parallely/simultanuesly.

-**ConcatMap(Serial Execution), SwitchMap(debauncing), exhaustMap(throttling)**
    - `ConcatMap` - Each observable is executed serially, ideal when order of execution is dependant on previous observable.
    - SwitchMap(debauncing), exhaustMap(throttling) - work on `Higher order observables`.
    - `SwitchMap` - Cancels previos observable in stream if new one comes in while previos one was in progress.
    - `exhaustMap` - Ignores all coming observables in stream if current one is in progress.

- **What is Debouncing and Throttling?**
    - Techniques used to handle and keep page more responsive in case of rapid input which could have hampered application performance.
    - Debauncing cancels previous event and starts timer for new one if next input/event was fired within timer.
    - vs
    - Throttling ignores subsequent events till timer for an active event is completed.
    - Debauncing is ideal when latest event is important.
    - Throttling is ideal when first event is important.

- **Difference between AngularJS and Angular.**
    - Change detection systems Digest cycle vs Change detection.
    - MVC archetecture vs Conponent based archetecture.
    - JS based, TS based.
    - All errors caught at runtime vs due to strong typing compile time errors are caught early.
    - Don't support Standalone components vs Does support.
    - Not able to use ENUMS and Interfaces vs able to use.
    - AngularJs supports Jest test framework vs Angular used to provide Jasmine framework.
- 
- **Angular 16 Features:**
  - Standalone
  - Angular Signals.
  - Enhanced Hydration.
  - Faster Builds with esbuild.
  - Experimental Jest Support.

- **What is JWT?**
    - Stands for json-web-token, used to provide security via token based session.
    - This secures application by refershing tokens every few minutes.
    - Created at login time and refreshed on timeouts.
    - Validated for each resource request on server side.

- **Is it needed to use jwt on socket**
    - Not for each data transfer, but advisable to use and validate on initial connection.

- **Where should Client store JWT?**
    - Possible to store on Localstorage/sessionstorage, Cookies.
    - Advisable to store in application cookies with HttpOnly flag=true, secure=true flag for https only and sameorigin if possible to keep client and server on same host.

- **What all information a JWT token has?**
    - Object used to create JWT toke.
    - Expries in time, Http flag, Secure flag.
    - No passwords should be store in it.

- **What is Profiling in Angular**
    - Technique/Process of measuring the performance of an Angular application to identify performance bottlenecks, optimize components, and improve the overall user experience.
    - how long certain operations take.
    - which areas of the app consume the most resources.
    - Angular DevTools extension.
    - Chrome DevTools Performance Tab.
    **Key Aspects of Profiling in Angular**
        - Change Detection Profiling.
        - Component Performance.
        - Memory Usage.
        - Event Handling and DOM Updates.
        - 

- **How to make routes/components protected in Angular?**
    - Using Accessbased check on routes using canActivate, canDeactivate etc.
    - This is just User guide and not actual resouce safety as actual security is supposed to be implemented at server end.
    - Each route that needs to be protected need to add canActivate in route in routes array.
    - Not all routes need to be protected.

- **Alternative methods to JWT.**
    - OAuth
    - Basic Auth.

- **Ways to pass data between unrelated components in Angular.**
    - Shared services.
    - Subjects/behaviorSubjects.
    - ngrx store.

- **Ways to pass data between related components.**
    - Input and Output Properties (Parent to Child and Child to Parent Communication).
    - ViewChild and ContentChild (Accessing Child Components).
    - Router (Passing Data with Route Parameters or Query Parameters).

- **What is change detection in Angular and how it works?**
    - core concept in Angular that allows the framework to update the user interface (UI) automatically when the data in the application changes.
    - change detection refers to the process of checking the components' data model and comparing it with the view.
    - change detection ensures that the view (HTML) is always in sync with the model.
    **How it works**
        - Component and Its Template:
        - Change Detection Cycle.
            - On Component Initialization.
            - When Data Changes: - Any time a data property bound to the template changes.

- **Change detection strategies**
    1. Default Change Detection Strategy (`ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default`).
        - Angular checks the entire component tree for changes(every component is checked on change detection is triggered.)
        - Inefficient in large applications.
    2. OnPush Change Detection Strategy (`ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`).
        - Updates if
            1. The componentâ€™s input properties change (i.e., new reference is passed).
            2. An event (e.g., click, input, etc.) is fired inside the component.
            3. Manually triggering change detection (via ChangeDetectorRef).
        - More efficient for complex applications.
        - Can be bad if mutable data is used as change detection won't trigger for mutable data update as referance don't update if only some value in it updated.
        - to manuallu trigger change detection.
            `constructor(private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef) {} this.cdr.detectChanges();`

- **What is role of Zone in angular**
    - Angular uses Zones to detect changes in the application.
    - When Async operations complete, the zone informs Angular to run change detection.

- **What is Lazy loading?**
    - Design pattern used in angular that delays loading of resources to improve intial load time.
    - It also prevents unecessory modules loading if not needed and loads only when needed.
    - **Benefits**
        - Faster initial load time.
        - Reduced memory consumption.
        - Improved user experience
        - Asynchronous Module Loading.

- **What are types of lazy loading in angular**
    - Module-based Lazy Loading (Standard Lazy Loading)
    - Preloading Strategy (Combined with Lazy Loading).
    - Lazy Loading with Route Guards
    - Nested Lazy Loading.

- **What is Content projection?**
    - content projection is done using the <ng-content></ng-content> element
    - Default Content Projection.
    - Multiple Slots for Content Projection (Named Slots).
    - Conditional Content Projection

- **List change detection strategies.**
    - Default.
    - OnPush.
