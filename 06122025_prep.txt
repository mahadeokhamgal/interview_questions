Here’s a focused 2–3 day preparation plan tailored exactly to this JD (Angular-focused Full-Stack/Front-End role at ~20+3.4 LPA, 5–6 YOE). I’ve split the questions into categories that almost always come up for this exact profile at product companies and good banks/fintechs in India.
Day 1: Core Angular + TypeScript + JavaScript (Expect 60-70% of questions from here)
Angular Fundamentals & Intermediate (Very High Probability)

1. Explain the Angular architecture (Modules, Components, Templates, Metadata, Services, DI).
 - Angular is component based framework to build Front end application, which provids out of the box solutions like DI, Two way Data binding, Reactive forms, Rxjs and so many more.
 - angular uses hierarchical model, where core module will have bootstrap component and that component will have all other components through hierarchy.
 - Modules,
  - Modules are way how application is seggregated, defined by @ngModule decorator, every angular aaplication will have core/main module and supporting modules.
  - Modules contain metadata suh as declarations, imports, providers, bootstrap (only for core/main module), exports.
 - Components,
  - Components have view/template, stylesheet, and component. it has it's state and states get updated based on change detection strategy used and changes happening in app/events/async pipe responses.
  - have metadata such as , templateUrl, styles, name, ChangeDetectionStrategy, standalone(angular 14+), imports(angular 14+), providers(angular 14+).
 - Templates,
  - These are html files that have binding to component state and will react to changes in component state. 
  - in html file, one can use normal html syntax, bindings, angular directives, pipes, ng-template for placeholders.
 - Metadata.
  - Metadata are properties of a class being defined in angular, this is provided inside decorator, and based on metadata angular will initialise the relevant component/service/pipe/directive/module.
  - this is powerful way because of which developers don't need to manually customise the behavior but use the ready meta properties.
 - Services.
  - Services are Injectable classes in angular, used to have business logic or to have shared states.
  - for providedIn root services only one instance is created for complete app and is shared across.
  - for providedIn any services, one instance for eager loaded modules and new child instance for each lazy loaded module is created.
 - DI.
  - DI is design pattern in angular. that removes need of a developer to manually maintain and provide access of service instance.
  - using constructor injection, service becomes accessible to consumer class.
  - Angular handles DI for providedIn root and any as per design i.e. for any the new child instance will be created.

Difference between Angular and AngularJS (or older frameworks you’ve used).
What are the different types of NgModules? When do you create a feature module vs shared module vs core module?
Component lifecycle hooks – exact order and when would you use ngOnChanges vs ngOnInit vs ngDoCheck vs ngAfterViewInit?
ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush – when and why to use it? How does it work internally?
What is Zone.js? Can Angular run without it?
Explain @Input, @Output, @ViewChild, @ViewChildren, @ContentChild with real examples.
Difference between constructor injection and injector.get() in services.
How do you share data between unrelated components? (Multiple ways – explain pros/cons).
What are Angular Reactive Forms vs Template-driven forms? When do you prefer one over the other?
Custom form validators (sync and async) – write one example.
What is the difference between declarations, providers, and imports in NgModule?
Lazy loading in Angular – how do you implement it today (Angular 18+ standalone way also)?
What are standalone components, pipes, directives? How is routing different now?
How do you handle HTTP Interceptors (Auth, logging, retry, caching)?
RxJS: Explain Observable vs Promise. Key operators you use daily (map, switchMap, mergeMap, concatMap, exhaustMap, tap, catchError, finalize, debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged).
Subject vs BehaviorSubject vs ReplaySubject vs AsyncSubject – when to use which?
How do you unsubscribe from observables to avoid memory leaks (multiple approaches)?
Angular Universal / SSR – why and basic idea.
What’s new in Angular 17/18 that you have used (signals, deferrable views, standalone by default, new control flow @if/@for)?

TypeScript & JavaScript (Medium–Hard)

Explain “this” binding in JS and how Arrow functions change it.
Closures – real use case in Angular.
Event loop, call stack, microtask queue – explain with setTimeout vs Promise.
TypeScript: Generics, Utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit, Record), keyof, typeof, decorators.
Difference between interface and type alias.
What are declaration files (.d.ts)?

Day 2: Testing, Micro-Frontends, System Design, CI/CD & Tools
Testing (They explicitly mention Jest & WDIO)

How do you write unit tests in Angular with Jasmine + Karma or Jest?
Difference between Jasmine and Jest? Have you migrated?
Testing components with dependencies (HttpClientTestingModule, RouterTestingModule).
How to test async code (fakeAsync/tick, waitForAsync)?
What is WebdriverIO (WDIO)? How is it different from Cypress/Protractor? Have you written E2E tests using it?
Mocking services in tests – TestBed vs manual mock.
Code coverage expectations in your current project.

Micro-Frontend Architecture (Preferred skill – high chance)

What is Micro-Frontend? Why do companies adopt it?
Different ways to implement Micro-Frontends (iframe, Web Components, Module Federation in Webpack 5, Single-SPA).
Have you used Module Federation? How do you share dependencies (Angular, RxJS) between shells and remotes?
How do you handle versioning and independent deployment in Micro-FE?

Git & CI/CD

Git rebase vs merge – when do you use which?
GitHub Actions or Jenkins pipelines you have set up for Angular builds.
What steps run in your CI/CD pipeline (lint, unit tests, e2e, build, deploy to S3/ECS etc.)?

System Design / Architecture (5–6 YOE level)

Design a large-scale Angular application folder structure (for 50+ developers).
How do you enforce scalability and maintainability (Nx monorepo vs multi-repo)?
State management – when do you prefer Services vs NgRx vs Signals + BehaviorSubject?
NgRx basics – Store, Actions, Reducers, Effects, Selectors (they may ask if you mention it).
Caching strategies in Angular (HTTP interceptor cache, NgRx, service-level cache).

Day 3: Cloud (AWS preferred), .NET/Web API (good to have), Behavioral & Past Experience
AWS (Preferred)

Basic services you have used (S3, CloudFront, CodePipeline, ECS/Fargate, Lambda, Amplify).
How do you deploy an Angular app to AWS (Amplify vs S3 + CloudFront vs CodePipeline).

.NET / Web API (Good to have – low probability but prepare basics)

REST API design principles you follow.
Difference between PUT vs PATCH.
Authentication mechanisms you have integrated from Angular (JWT, OAuth2, Azure AD).

Behavioral & Project Deep Dive (Almost guaranteed)

Tell me about the most complex Angular project you have worked on (architecture, team size, challenges).
A time when you improved performance of an Angular app (AOT, lazy loading, OnPush, trackBy, etc.).
A bug that was very hard to debug – how did you find it?
Conflict with teammate on code quality / architecture – how did you resolve?
