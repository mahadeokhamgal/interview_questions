JavaScript (Core & Advanced)

Explain how this binding works in a nested arrow function inside a regular function that’s called with .call(). Provide an example.
Write a function deepClone that clones nested objects and arrays, handles circular references, and preserves Date, Map, and Set objects.
Implement a debounce function that works with async functions and returns a promise. How would you test it?
What’s the output? Explain why:jsconst obj = { a: 1 };
const arr = [obj];
obj.b = arr;
console.log(JSON.stringify(obj));
Create a custom EventEmitter class with on, off, once, and emit methods. Support wildcard listeners (*).
How would you implement private class fields using Proxies? Demonstrate with an example.
Write a generator function that yields promises in sequence and resolves them one by one (like async/await but with generators).
Explain the difference between Event Loop and Job Queue (microtasks). Show a code snippet where order matters.
Implement a Promise.allSettled polyfill that returns results in the original order, even if some reject.

2. Explain the difference between Renderer2 and direct DOM manipulation. When would you use each in a directive?
3. How does hydration lifecycle for SSR work in angular?
4. Create a structural directive *appUnless that works like *ngIf but shows content when the condition is false.

6. What happens when you use async pipe with an Observable that errors? How to handle it gracefully in the template?
7. Implement an HttpInterceptor that retries failed requests with exponential backoff and cancels duplicates.
8. How do you share data between unrelated components without a service (e.g., using BehaviorSubject vs TransferState vs window.postMessage)?
