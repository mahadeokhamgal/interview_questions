Here are 20 sharp, senior-level Angular brainteasers (5–8 YOE, 25+ LPA caliber) that top companies (FAANG-tier, fintech, product unicorns) actually ask in System Design + Deep Angular rounds. These separate 25 LPA from 40+ LPA candidates.

Change Detection Deep Dive
Explain how Angular’s change detection works under the hood (Zone.js → monkey-patched async APIs → ApplicationRef.tick). When does Angular skip checking a component even if OnPush is not used?

OnPush vs Default Strategy Performance
You have a dashboard with 10,000 rows in an ngFor. The data never mutates, only replaces. Explain exactly why OnPush + immutable objects is 50–100x faster than Default strategy here.

Memory Leak Scenario
You see a massive memory leak in production. DevTools shows thousands of detached DOM trees with your component.
What’s the most common Angular-specific cause and how do you fix it without takeUntil?

RxJS Backpressure
An API emits 10,000 events/sec, you subscribe with subscribe(). The app freezes.
Name 5 different RxJS operators/combinations to handle this without losing data or freezing UI.

Ivy Rendering Engine
Explain the difference between View Engine and Ivy at the compiler and runtime level. How does Ivy enable tree-shakable providers and locality?

Dynamic Component Loading Gone Wrong
You lazy-load 50 feature modules. Bundle size is still 5 MB. What Angular-specific mistake did you likely make?

Angular Universal + TransferState Bug
After adding SSR, some API calls happen twice (once on server, once on client). How do you fix it properly using TransferState without breaking SEO?

Signal vs RxJS in Angular 17+
When would you choose Signals over RxJS in a real-world large app (e.g., trading dashboard)? When would you still pick RxJS?

Custom Async Pipe
Implement a) Why can’t you use multiple async pipes on the same observable in template without performance issues?
b) Write a reusable PureAsyncPipe that subscribes only once.

NgZone Nightmare
You run a heavy computation inside NgZone.runOutsideAngular(). UI stops updating. Explain why and give three correct ways to update UI from outside zone.
Dependency Injection Tree Shaking
Explain why providedIn: 'root' + Ivy makes almost all services tree-shakable, but providedIn: 'any' breaks it in large apps.
Standalone Components Migration
You migrate a 200-module app to standalone. What breaks with Angular Material, Router lazy loading with loadComponent, and default exports?
Angular Elements
You publish your component as a Web Component. Consumers complain styles leak globally. How do you fix it at build time (not ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom)?
Interceptor Ordering & Auth Refresh
Auth token is expired → 401 → refresh token call → retry original request. Write the correct interceptor order and logic so that parallel requests don’t trigger 50 refresh calls.
Performance: ngTemplateOutlet vs Component
You have a table with 5000 rows, each with 3 different cell templates. When is ngTemplateOutlet dramatically faster than creating 15,000 components?
AOT vs JIT in Production
Name three things that fail only in AOT but work in JIT (common in interviews).
Control Flow Syntax (@if, @for) Internals
Explain how Angular compiles the new @for syntax differently from *ngFor and why the new one is 30–90% faster with OnPush.
Hydration in Angular 17+
Explain non-destructive hydration vs full SSR re-render. What breaks hydration in real apps and how do you debug it?
Micro-frontends with Module Federation
You expose an Angular shell + 5 remote Angular apps using Module Federation. Shell takes 8 seconds to load. Most common mistake?
The Ultimate Gotcha
This code runs without error in dev but crashes only in production AOT:TypeScriptconstructor(private injector: Injector) {}
ngOnInit() {
  setTimeout(() => {
    this.http.get('/api/data').subscribe();
  });
}Explain exactly why and the correct fix.

Bonus (asked at Google/Uber):
21. Design an Angular architecture for a real-time trading dashboard handling 1000+ price updates/sec with <16ms UI latency. Draw the data flow (WebSocket → NgRx/Signals → components) and justify every choice.
These questions consistently filter out 25 LPA developers from 40–70 LPA ones. Good luck — nail these and you’re golden! 🚀
