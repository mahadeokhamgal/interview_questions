What will be the output of following program:
Question: 

class Parent {
 public static void display() {
 System.out.println("Static method in Parent class");
 }
}

class Child extends Parent {
 public static void display() {
 System.out.println("Static method in Child class");
 }
}

public class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 Parent p = new Child();
 p.display(); // Output?
 
 Child c = new Child();
 c.display(); // Output?
 }
}

followup Question: If we remove static from display() in both classes, what will be the output? 🤔
